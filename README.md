# Chicago Taxi Project Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis conducted on the Chicago taxi trips dataset. The dataset encompasses taxi trip records from 2013 to 2019, providing valuable insights into the local taxi business landscape in Chicago. The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement within the taxi industry.

## Key Findings
- **Driver Affiliation:** Approximately 15.1% of taxi drivers operate as individual taxis without affiliation to any company, indicating potential challenges in service consistency.
- **Fare Amount Variability:** Fare amounts fluctuate between $10 to $17, with spikes observed in certain months, highlighting the need for fare stabilization strategies.
- **Peak Hour Driver Availability:** Limited availability of taxis during peak hours, particularly at 5am, leading to long wait times for passengers.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Drastic decrease in the number of individual taxi drivers in 2017, suggesting the impact of regulatory changes on driver participation.
- **Service Disparities Across Areas:** Unequal distribution of taxi services across community areas, indicating potential gaps in service availability and quality.
- **Payment Method Preferences:** 59.3% of payments made in cash, posing operational challenges and security risks.
- **Anomalies in Extras Payments:** Spike in extras payments observed in May 2019, indicating potential anomalies or discrepancies in payment processing.

## Proposed Strategies
- Encourage affiliation with taxi companies to improve service consistency.
- Implement dynamic pricing algorithms for fare stabilization.
- Incentivize drivers to operate during peak demand hours.
- Investigate factors contributing to the decline in driver participation.
- Optimize dispatching algorithms for equitable service distribution.
- Promote cashless payment options and provide training to drivers.
- Implement fraud detection measures to identify irregularities in payment processing.
